# 1.4. Testing (Level 1 - Exercise 2)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Create a class called CalculateDNI that calculates the letter of the DNI when receiving the number as a parameter.
Create a jUnit class that verifies its correct functioning, parameterizing it so that the test receives a wide data spectrum and validates if the calculation is correct for 10 predefined ID numbers".

The goal is to practice algorithm implementation and unit testing in Java, focusing on both functional logic and testing best practices.
